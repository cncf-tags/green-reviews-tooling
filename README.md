# CNCF Green Reviews WG

The CNCF Green Reviews Working Group (WG) is an open-source, community-led project that is part of the [CNCF Environmental Sustainability Technical Advisory Group (TAG ENV)](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability).

The aim of the Green Reviews WG is to set up infrastructure to measure the sustainability footprint of [CNCF Projects](https://www.cncf.io/projects).
