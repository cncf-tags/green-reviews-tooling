# Collaboration with CNCF Projects

Some notes about this project:
* This project aims to provide an architectural reference for how to assess the sustainability footprint of a cloud-native application (including the SCI) using cloud-native tooling.
* The community cluster aims to provide a playground for emerging metrics related to environmental sustainability, such as the [Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specification](https://sci-guide.greensoftware.foundation).
* The Green Reviews pipeline is also inspired by the process established by [TAG Securityâ€™s Security Assessment (TSSA)](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/tree/main/assessments) for CNCF Projects.

## Add a CNCF Project to the pipeline

We would like to generate the SCI score for more CNCF Projects. Our goal is to set an example for how to monitor the sustainability footprint of cloud-native applications and tooling.

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/cncf-tags/green-reviews-tooling/issues/new/choose) in our repository to register your interest in adding a CNCF Project to the pipeline. We look forward to hearing from the community.

## CNCF Project Maintainer Responsibilities

There are different roles and responsibilities involved in the review of the CNCF Projects. What do CNCF Project Maintainers provide? What does the Green Reviews WG provide? These questions are being answered through the current active collaboration with the maintainers of Falco.

There are certain key differences around the deployment and implementation that vary for each project. CNCF Project Maintainers can help with the following:

- Share any requirements for deploying the CNCF Project on Kubernetes or running the benchmarks;
- Provide and maintain the installation for the CNCF Project (and any resources required by the benchmark test e.g. synthetic workloads) in the community cluster;
- Contribute test scenarios for a specific CNCF Project, which should roughly be equivalent to the [functional unit](https://sci-guide.greensoftware.foundation/R) of the tool's SCI calculation;

CNCF Projects are welcome to flag their interest to collaborate with the Green Reviews WG by leaving a comment in [this issue](https://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability/issues/223).

## Project 1: Falco

Falco is the first project to go through the TAG ENV Green Review pipeline.

One thing that has worked well is that Falco created a separate repository, [cncf-green-review-testing](https://github.com/falcosecurity/cncf-green-review-testing), to facilitate this collaboration.
