# Proposal 002 - Run the CNCF project benchmark tests as part of the automated pipeline

This is step 2 from the automated pipeline to evaluate the carbon emissions of a CNCF project: Run benchmarking tests of the project (probably created for this purpose). See also step 1: [Trigger and Deploy](./proposal-001-trigger-and-deploy.md).

## Summary

<!--
A good summary is at least a paragraph in length and should be written with a wide audience
in mind.

It should encompass the entire document, and serve as both future documentation
and as a quick reference for people coming by to learn the proposal's purpose
without reading the entire thing.

Both in this section and below, follow the guidelines of the [documentation
style guide]. In particular, wrap lines to a reasonable length, to make it
easier for reviewers to cite specific portions, and to minimize diff churn on
updates.

## Motivation

<!--
This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals and non-goals of
this proposal. Describe why the change is important, how it fits into the project's
goals and the benefits to users.

It is helpful to frame this to answer the question: "What is the problem this proposal
is trying to solve?"
-->

This proposal is part of the pipeline automation of the Green Reviews tooling for Falco (and new CNCF projects in the future). Currently, we are using Flux to watch the upstream Falco repository and run the benchmark workflow (See definition below) constantly. For example, [this benchmark job](https://github.com/falcosecurity/cncf-green-review-testing/blob/main/kustomize/falco-driver/ebpf/stress-ng.yaml#L27-L32) is set up as a Kubernetes Deployment that runs an endless loop of [`stress-ng`](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Reference/stress-ng), which applies stress to the kernel. Instead, this proposal aims to provide a solution for how to deploy the benchmark workflows only when they are needed.

Secondly, automating the way we run benchmark workflows in this pipeline will help to make the process easier and faster. It will enable both the WG Green Reviews and CNCF project maintainers to come up with new benchmark jobs and run them to get feedback faster.

### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the proposal. What is it trying to achieve? How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

  - Describe the actions to take immediately after the trigger and deployment of the CNCF project defined in [Proposal 1](./proposal-001-trigger-and-deploy.md)
  - Describe how the pipeline should _fetch_ the benchmarks either from this repository (`cncf-tags/green-reviews-tooling`) or from an upstream repository (e.g. Falco's [`falcosecurity/cncf-green-review-testing`](https://github.com/falcosecurity/cncf-green-review-testing)).
  - Describe how the pipeline should _run_ the benchmarks through GitHub Actions for a specific project e.g. Falco
  - Communicate to CNCF Projects interested in a Green Review what is the structure they need to comply in the process of creating a new benchmark job
  - Provide _modularity_ for the benchmark tests.

### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this proposal? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.

It is important to remember that non-goals are still equally important things
which will be dealt with one day but are not things which need to be dealt with immediately
within the scope of this work. This helps make sure everyone is crystal clear on the outcomes.
-->

* Defining or designing the content of benchmark tests themselves, or assigning responsibility for who should write them.

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is:
outlining your solution to the problem described in the Motivation section.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

### User Stories

<!--
Detail the things that people will be able to do if this proposal is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system. The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.
-->

**CNCF project maintainer selects the right benchmark for their project**

Since different CNCF projects need different benchmarks to reproduce the right metrics, as a project maintainer, I would like to select the benchmarks reproducing a k8s context as realistic as possible.

**CNCF project maintainer creates a new benchmark for their project**

If the available benchmarks are not enough to set a realistic context, I would like to create and run my own benchmark

**Green Reviews maintainer helps to create a new benchmark test for a specific CNCF project**

As a Green Reviews maintainer, I can help a CNCF project maintainers to define the Functional Unit of a project so that the project maintainers can create a benchmark test.

**CNCF Project maintainer modifies or removes a benchmark test**

As a project maintainer, I can edit or remove a benchmark test if it is in a repository owned by the CNCF project itself, or otherwise if itâ€™s in the Green Reviews repository by making a pull request with the changes.

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal, and how do we mitigate?
Think broadly.  For example, consider how this will impact or be impacted
by scaling to support more CNCF Projects.

How will this affect the benchmark tests, CNCF Project Maintainers, pipeline maintainers, etc?
-->

As with every design document, there are multiple risks:

- Extensibility: At the moment Falco is the first and only project that requested a Green Review (very appreciated guinea pig ðŸ™‚). When other CNCF projects will request other Green Reviews, we will learn more and adapt the project as needed.

- Scalability: Green Reviews contributors should empower and encourage CNCF project maintainers to create benchmark jobs. The right collaboration will enable Green Reviews maintainers to scale to multiple projects (cause they will not need to understand the deployment details of every project) while producing higher quality metrics (cause the project is set up by the experts).

- Validity: this point is less trivial and also conflicting with the one above but worth mention. If every single project defines its own benchmarks how will it be possible to compare different Projects result? This needs [deeper investigation that will be discussed in a separate proposal](https://github.com/cncf-tags/green-reviews-tooling/issues/103.)


## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include manifests or workflow examples
(though not always required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity
about HOW your proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

Let's recap some of the components defined in [Proposal 1](proposal-001-trigger-and-deploy.md):
1. **Green Reviews pipeline**: the Continuous Integration pipeline which deploys a CNCF project to a test cluster, runs a set of benchmarks while measuring carbon emissions and stores the results. It is implemented by the workflows listed below.
2. **Cron workflow**: This refers to the initial GitHub Action workflow (described in proposal 1) and which dispatches a project workflow (see next definition), as well as a delete workflow to clean up the resources created by the project workflow.
3. **Project workflow**: The project workflow is dispatched by the Cron workflow. A project workflow can be, for example, a Falco workflow. A project workflow deploys the project and runs the benchmarks (see below). A project workflow can be dispatched more than once if there are multiple project variants/setups. In addition, a Project workflow, which is also just another GitHub Action workflow, contains a list of GitHub Action Jobs.
4. **Delete/cleanup workflow**: This is the one to make sure that the resources created by the project workflow are deleted so the environments go back to the initial state.

This proposal adds the following components:

5. **[new] Benchmark job**: a GitHub Actions job that applies the benchmark manifest using `kubectl apply -f`, waits the duration of the benchmark and deletes the manifest resources with `kubectl delete -f`.
6. **[new] Benchmark manifest**: A YAML file with the Kubernetes resources such as Deployments that deploy the benchmarking workload.

The manifest URL and benchmarking duration are configured via the [projects.json](../projects/projects.json).

```json
{
    "projects": [
        {
            "name": "falco",
            "organization": "falcosecurity",
            "benchmark": {
                "k8s_manifest_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/falcosecurity/cncf-green-review-testing/e93136094735c1a52cbbef3d7e362839f26f4944/benchmark-tests/falco-benchmark-tests.yaml",
                "duration_mins": 15
            },
            "configs": [
                "ebpf",
                "modern-ebpf",
                "kmod"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Benchmark job

The benchmark job applies the manifest using kubectl. The functional unit test is time-bound in the case of Falco and scoped to 15 minutes. Therefore, we deploy this test, wait for 15 minutes, then delete the manifest to end the loop. The test steps depend on the functional unit of each CNCF project. The wait duration is configurable via the `duration_mins` field in the project.json.

The benchmark job is also responsible for deleting the manifests either after the wait duration or sooner if an error has occurred.

### Benchmark manifest

At a bare minimum, the benchmark manifest must contain Kubernetes resources for what should run in the Kubernetes cluster and which namespace should be used. For example, the Falco project maintainers have identified that one way to test the Falco project is through a test that runs `stress-ng` for a given period of time. The steps are contained in a Deployment manifest which is directly applied to the community cluster using `kubectl`

Below are two use cases: the benchmark manifests may be defined in the Green Reviews repository or in a separate repository.

#### Use Case 1: Benchmark manifest is defined in the _same_ repository (preferred)

Hosting the manifests in the Green Reviews repository is preferred for both simplicity and security. This is also preferred for generic benchmarks that can apply to multiple CNCF projects.

#### Use Case 2: Benchmark manifest is defined in a _different_ repository

We want to accommodate different methods of setting up the tests depending on the CNCF project. Given this, the benchmark manifest could be defined in a different repository. In this case, the `k8s_manifest_url` would be, for example, `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/falcosecurity/cncf-green-review-testing/e93136094735c1a52cbbef3d7e362839f26f4944/benchmark-tests/falco-benchmark-tests.yaml`.

Applying manifests from a different repository not controlled by Green Reviews is a potential security risk. See next section.

### Versioning / Security

Manifests in `project.json` are pinned to a Git commit SHA rather than a branch such as `main`. This mitigates the risk that a malicious workload could be included in the benchmark manifest and ensures that any changes to the manifests are reviewed by one of the Green Reviews maintainers.

### Authentication

Before the benchmark workflow is called on, we assume that the workflow already contains a secret with a kubeconfig to authenticate with the test cluster and Falco has already been deployed to it. It is required that the pipeline authenticates with the Kubernetes cluster before running the job with the test.

## Drawbacks (Optional)

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

## Alternatives

Here a list of the alternatives we considered:

- **calling benchmarks as reusable GitHub Actions workflows**: was originally selected but calling workflows with the [uses](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows#calling-a-reusable-workflow) directive does not support using parameterized values.  

- **mapping between benchmark manifests and CNCF projects**: we have decided for a 1:1 relationship, every project will only have one benchmark manifest, again for simplicity. We could add support for 1:many in the future

## Infrastructure Needed (Optional)

<!--
Use this section if you need things from the project/SIG. Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, or GitHub details. Listing these here allows a
SIG to get the process for these resources started right away.
-->

<!-- TODO:
* Creating a template for how to "register" a benchmark test with everything that is needed and clear instructions on how to add a new one. Audience is primarily CNCF project maintainers. -->
