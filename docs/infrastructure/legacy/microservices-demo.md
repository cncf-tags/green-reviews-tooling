# Install via Flux

We opted in for installing microservice demo using flux-oci. Example [here](https://fluxcd.io/flux/cheatsheets/oci-artifacts).
A temporaryconfiguration file can be found under [microservices-demo.yaml](https://github.com/cncf-tags/green-reviews-tooling/blob/main/clusters/projects/falco/microservices-demo.yaml).
